# Automatic and Manual Tranmissions on Miles per Gallon
We examine the effect of transmissions, either being automatic or manual, of 32 automobiles controlling for other design and performance aspects, based on the *mtcars* dataset. When controlling for confounders selected using stepwise AIC algorithm (number of cylinders, horsepower, and weight), transmissions have a slight effect on miles per gallon but it is not statistically significant.

It is part of the Coursera Data Specialization's [Regression Models](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/GZ9B7PMXA5UU) final project.
